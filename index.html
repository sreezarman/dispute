            <div class="space-y-4 text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
                <p>Despite working with Breathe Media Network for over two years, repeated delays in payment have now escalated beyond tolerance.</p>
                <p>Work concluded in February 2025.</p>
                <p>The final compiled invoice was issued in the first week of March.</p>
                <p>As of July 2025, <strong>$9,000 remains unpaid</strong>, despite multiple documented follow-ups.</p>
                <p>This is not an isolated incident. Throughout the engagement, payments were repeatedly delayed by 2‚Äì3 months, with no accountability. Every payment required repeated follow-ups. There has been no consistency, respect, or ownership from their side‚Äîeven when commitments were made.</p>
